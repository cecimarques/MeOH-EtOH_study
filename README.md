Hello :)

Welcome to further supplementary information of our paper xxx.

Inside the directory **Simulation_files** you can find the microstates attained by the end of the production run at ambient conditions for all of the 11 systems studied in our work, namely pure EtOH, pure MeOH and MeOH/EtOH binary mixtures at ratios 1:9, 1:4, 3:7, 2:3, 1:1, 3:2, 7:3, 4:1, 9:1. These are given in the form of LAMMPS data files (atom_style full). As potential parameters are included in the file, files for all four force fields used in the assessment at ambient conditions are provided. (...)
Note that the production run was made using equations of motion originally formulated to sample the NPT ensemble, and thus the volume of the simulation domain *does not* correspond to the average volume at ambient temperature and pressure conditions.

Inside the directory **Post_processing_codes** you can find all python codes written in-house that were used in the post-processing of simulation files aiming to assess properties of the systems studied in our work. These are Hbond_lifetime_ME.py, (xxx). Comments can find throughout the code to assist with the understanding of their different bits. Note that since the molecular simulations involved in this work were performed in LAMMPS, these codes usually work with input files that are in LAMMPS-related formatting.
- The code Hbond_lifetime_ME.py corresponds to the code used to compute the time autocorrelation functions necessary for later estimating the continuous hydrogen bond life time between hydrogens of methanol and oxygens of ethanol. There was one code for each of the four hydrogen types found in the binary methanol/ethanol mixtures, namely H(MeOH)...O(MeOH), H(MeOH)...O(EtOH), H(EtOH)...O(MeOH), H(EtOH)...O(EtOH), with the code in each of the four cases following the same frame (only minor changes/adaptations are required). The calculation follows the specifics described in the supplementary information of the paper.
- The code O(EtOH)_statistics.py coresponds to the code used to assess the "hydrogen bond" coordination shell of oxygens of ethanol molecules. There was a separate code for O(MeOH), where only minor changes/adaptations are required since the frame of the code is the same. The specifics of this assessment is described in the supplementary information of the paper.
