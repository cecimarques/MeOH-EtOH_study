Here you can find .opju files containing (i) simulated structural results at ambient pressure (x-ray analogue PDF, PDFs for intermolecular O...H pairs that are capable of hydrogen-bonding, angle distribution functions, PDFs built for the center of mass of the molecules) for all MeOH-EtOH systems investigated. The force field the results concern can duly found in the name of the files.
