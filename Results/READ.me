Here you can find .opju files containing 
(i) simulated structural results at ambient pressure (x-ray analogue PDF, PDFs for intermolecular O...H pairs that are capable of hydrogen-bonding, angle distribution functions, PDFs built for the center of mass of the molecules, coordination number of oxygens, continuous hydrogen bond lifetime) for all MeOH-EtOH systems investigated. When a file concerns the results of a specific force field, the name of the force fields appear indicated in the file name. Otherwise, the file is a compilation of the results obtained for all force fields.
(ii) densities at high pressure. Note that these results are available only for CGenFF and OPLS-AA, as TraPPE and Gabriela were not included in the investigation at high pressure.
