Here you can find .opju files containing 
(i) simulated structural results at ambient pressure (x-ray analogue PDF, PDFs for intermolecular O...H pairs that are capable of hydrogen-bonding, angle distribution functions, PDFs built for the center of mass of the molecules, coordination number of oxygens, continuous hydrogen bond lifetime) for all MeOH-EtOH systems investigated. When a file concerns the results of a specific force field, the name of the force fields appear indicated in the file name. Otherwise, the file is a compilation of the results obtained for all force fields considered in the assessmente of the given property. In the case of the file containing the x-ray analogue simulated PDF, data for the experimental PDFs obtained by x-ray diffraction are also presented.
(ii) self diffusion coefficient, densities and x-ray analogue PDF at high pressure obtained in the simulations. Note that these results are available only for CGenFF and OPLS-AA, as TraPPE and Gabriela were not included in the investigation at high pressure.

Note that if you do not have access to Origin, you can still download for free a viewer in order to access the data (e.g. copy paste it elsehwere). See https://www.originlab.com/viewer/
