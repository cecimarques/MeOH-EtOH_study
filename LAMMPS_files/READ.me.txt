Inside the directories CGenFF, OPLS-AA, Gabriela and TraPPE you can find out LAMMPS data files for pure MeOH, pure EtOH and several MeOH-EtOH mixtures containing the potential parameters for each of the four force fields considered in our work. The microstate in tihs file corresponds to the final one attained after the production run at ambient conditions (duration of the equilibration varied as needed). In the case of the MeOH-EtOH mixtures, the LAMMPS data file names indicate the volume ratio of MeOH (first index) to EtOH (second index). It is worth noting that both TraPPE and the Gabriela et al force fields prescribe intramolecular constraints for the molecules. In the former case, the constraints are about bond length, which were implemented by using a large value of force constant in the bond potential.* In the case of the Gabriela et al force field, the constraint concerns all intramolecular degrees of freedom, and were implemented within LAMMPS by using the fix rigid family of commands.
* Usage of the shake algorithm in LAMMPS was not possible due to the maximum number of "fix shake" and "fix rattle" commands that can be invoked in the simulation. Bond distribution functions were built for all bonds in all systems to confirm that the bond length values prescribed within TraPPE was satisfactorily reproduced at ambient conditions.
PS: It is worth noting that CGenFF prescribes more than one dihedral potential of the form given by the dihedral_style charmm (see https://docs.lammps.org/dihedral_charmm.html) for some dihedrals. This was implemented within LAMMPS by declaring these dihedrals more than once in the "Dihedrals" section under a different dihedral type.
PS2: dont take comment lines in these LAMMPS data files too seriously.

Finally, the lammps_cgenff.in and lammps_oplsaa.in show the LAMMPS input script used to carry out the molecular dynamics simulation at high pressures using the CGenFF and OPLS-AA force fields, respectively. In our work, these simulations started from the LAMMPS data files made available in the CGenFF and OPLS-AA directory for each corresponding system. Naturally, these input files also contain further details about the force field, such as mixing rules, long range solver used and so on.** As mentioned in the manuscript, no simulations at high pressure were made using the Gabriela et al and TraPPE force fields as the intramolecular constraints prescribed by these may hinder its applicability to model the interactions under compression. So, since no simulation at high pressure for these two force fields exist, the setup for the force field that would be in a LAMMPS input file to run an MD simulation is given below for completion, in case you would like to run any simulation for MeOH-EtOH using these force fields.
** Note that even though the default mixing rules within LAMMPS are the "mix geometric" (see https://docs.lammps.org/pair_modify.html), the fact that a "charmm pairstyle" is used changes it to "mix arithmetic", hence the absence of a pair_modify command in the the lammps_cgenn.in file.
