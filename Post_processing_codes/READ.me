The code Hbond_lifetime.py corresponds to the in-house python code used to compute the continuous hydrogen bond life time between hydrogens of methanol and oxygens of ethanol. There was one code for each of the four hydrogen types found in the binary methanol/ethanol mixtures, namely H(MeOH)...O(MeOH), H(MeOH)...O(EtOH), H(EtOH)...O(MeOH), H(EtOH)...O(EtOH), but the code for each of the four cases follows the same scheme, with only minor changes being required. The calculation follows the specifics described in the supplementary information of the paper.
